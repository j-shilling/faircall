This is a program I wrote and used when I was still a teaching in public schools. It was a way to ensure that I was calling on students, not forgetting anyone, and not calling on one person too much. It keeps the calls unpredictable by only promising to not call on someone twice in a row (so students would not space out right after getting called on), but also keeps things fair by checking the standard deviation of the number of times each student was called on.
